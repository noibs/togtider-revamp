<h1>Togtider</h1>

Togtider _(Traintimes in Danish)_ is a simple and intuitive dashboard to check upcoming trains on your prefered route. <br>
It's works using the Danish [Rejseplanen API](https://help.rejseplanen.dk/hc/da/articles/214174465-Rejseplanens-API) and aims to give you all the information you need, as quickly as possible.
